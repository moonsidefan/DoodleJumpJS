## The build is unminified. 

If you want to contribute to make a good readable source code out of this, I would appreciate this.

### How to start/install the game?

You have to put all the files on a webserver. This can also be localhost. This is due to Phaser (the JavaScript Engine) requesting the game to not run in the file system. I don't know whether this can be changed since this is a older version of Phaser.

Currently the game crashes if you die or want to check the global scoreboard.

### What is the goal of this project?

The goal of it is to make this a fully bug-free and enjoyabel game, that has an code easy to read and to understand.
The code regardig ads, promotion for the mobile versions of the game and the global score board shall be removed, since it is not nescessary for the game or hard to implement.
This lays the groundwork for modifications or features that the mobile versions currently have.
Think of it as an decompilation project except for that the game's code is already availyable, just really hard to read.
